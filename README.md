# FriendlyNeighborhoodBlank
Our app to connect people in their surrounding communities to people (Friendly Neighborhood Blanks) with skills or interests they want to learn more about.  
I led three teammates as project manager to complete and submit this project within the 12-hour hackathon, UBC Local Hackday 2018.
